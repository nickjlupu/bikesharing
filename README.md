## Analysis
Several charts were developed from the .csv for the NYC data from August 2019.  August was chosen because it would be a warm, summer month with a lot of bikes being utilized by commuters and tourists alike.  

Despite the total population of Des Moines being 2.5% of NYC, the age and gender breakdowns are similar.  
* Ages 18-64
  * New York:  65.0%  
  * Des Moines:  63.8%
* % Female
  * New York: 52.3%  
  * Des Moines: 50.8%

Obviously Des Moines would require a lot less bikes and stations than NYC.  Further study would be needed to determine these figures.  In my opinion, investors would need to see this type of study to deterine how much capital needs to be committed to this project.  

### Issues
Something happened to the data as I worked through this project and about half of the data disappeared.  I chose not to take the time to go back and start from the beginning.
